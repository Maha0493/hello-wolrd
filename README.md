+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Hi Everyone!+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 
 My name is Maha. I recently completed my Bachelor of Science Degree with a high distinction at Saint Maryâ€™s University, Halifax.  By taking computer science and business administration, an interdisciplinary four year degree combining computing science, with a selection of courses taught in the Sobey School of Business, I acquired valuable technical skills, learned how to think clearly and communicate effectively. I am exceptionally organized and detail-oriented, by nature, with an innate creative sense.
